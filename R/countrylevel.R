#' countrylevel: What a Waste Country level
#'
#' What a Waste is a global project to aggregate data on solid waste management
#  from around the world. This database features the statistics collected
#  through the effort, covering nearly all countries and over 330 cities.
#  The metrics included cover all steps from the waste management value chain,
#  including waste generation, composition, collection, and disposal, as well as
#  information on user fees and financing, the informal sector, administrative
#  structures, public communication, and legal information. The information
#  presented is the best available based on a study of current literature and
#  limited conversations with waste agencies and authorities. While there may be
#  variations in the definitions and quality of reporting for individual data
#  points, general trends should reflect the global reality. All sources and any
#  estimations are noted.
